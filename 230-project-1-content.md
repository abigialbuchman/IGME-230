# Soul Fisher

## High Concept

A dead Captain Ahab must fish and fight his way down the river styx to defeat his one true enemy, that blasted white whale in this game in this game similar to Contra without the plateforming. 

## Genre and Platform
            
* Gameplay genre: Shooter Side Scroller
* Platform: Web Only

## Story

Captain Ahab has finally met his maker in his attempt to bring down the white whale, but that just means that his quest has changed locations. Play as Captain Ahab as he chases the whale down the river styx and fight off the lonely souls to achieve his death's missions.

## Aesthetics

The graphics style will be 16-bit pixel art with ambient music as well as sound effects.
            
## Gameplay

The goal of the game is to aim and shoot demons and other lost souls with Captain Ahab's harpoon to try and get to the final boss of the game, That Cursed White Whale. The player will use the up and down arrow keys to aim the harpoon and the space bar to shoot. There won't a tourtorial in a traditional sense, but there will be onsreen cues and intrustions during the first bit of the game. The player will get better harpoon gun add ons, like more powerful harpoons, harpoons that have different powers - like geting a demon who has been shot to attack other demons. The add ons will help as the demons will also gain power ups as the game goes on, and the final boos will also be difficult to defeat.

## Mood and Other

The mood of the game will be creepy, but fun creepy, like Courage the Cowardly Dog or Gravity Falls. While the game will have spooky elements because you are going through hades, but it is not a horror game.
